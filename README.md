### Math Note Taker

A web app that I built to take math notes over the years.  I am not happy with using `LaTex` for typing out math symbols.  The app is inspired by various editors/tools I came across online.

### Tools used
- MathJax: inputing math symbols
- Plotly: inserting plot functions
- React: editor UI
- express: local server, serving and saving notes

### How to run
```
npm install
node app.js
```
